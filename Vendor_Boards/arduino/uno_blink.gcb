'  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
'
'  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control.
'  On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to PORTB.5 (digital pin 13)
'  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on
'  your Arduino model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

#chip mega328p, 16    ' Declare the Target Processor and Speed
#option explicit      ' Require Explicit declaration of Variables

#define LED PORTB.5   ' Define the LED Pin

' Setup
Dir LED Out           ' Make the LED Pin an Output

' Main                ' This loop runs over and over forever.
