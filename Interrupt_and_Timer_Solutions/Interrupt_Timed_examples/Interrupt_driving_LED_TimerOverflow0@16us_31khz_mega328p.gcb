'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''     Description.
'''    A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB.
'''    This adjusts the power to the LED over 2.5 seconds, then to zero power again over 2.5 seconds with a hold of 1 second between each ramp up/dowwn.
'''    Timer0 overflows every 15.8us. We use this overflow to create the PWM'ed LED.
'''    The LED is connected to Portb.5 via appropiate resistors.
